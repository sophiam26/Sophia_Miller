### Welcome to my website

I am a 26 year old MPH student at the Mailman School of Public Health. I am originally from Woodstock, New York and now live here in NYC.

On this site, you can find my resume, links to my email and Github page, and a dashboard using data from Instacart to show my knowledge of R.


For fun, here are some pictures from my summer practicum in Zimbabwe:
